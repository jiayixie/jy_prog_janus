We are pleased to announce the version 1.0.2 release of Mineos.
Mineos computes synthetic seismograms in a spherically symmetric
non-rotating Earth by summing normal modes.

To build Mineos, you will need a Fortran compiler.  If you are running
Linux, you should be able to get gfortran from your distribution.  If
you are running Windows, the easiest way is to install Cygwin
(cygwin.com).  If you are running Mac OS X, you can download a Fortran
compiler from

  http://hpc.sourceforge.net

Once you have a fortran compiler, run configure

  ./configure

If it can not find the Fortran compiler, you can tell it where it is
with the FC variable

  ./configure F77=/path/to/fortran/compiler

If that succeeds, then run "make" to build Mineos.

The file INSTALL has more detailed instructions on how to build
Mineos.

The manual is at doc/mineos.pdf.

If you have any problems, please send a message to
    cig-seismo@geodynamics.org

MINEOS is free software.  See the file COPYING for copying conditions.

Rftn Inversion Programs

snglinv 
	invert one waveform with one initial
	model

smthinv
	invert one waveform with one initial model
	and 10 smoothness weighting factors
	you input min and max sigma.

manyinv
	invert one waveform with a multiple of
	4 intial models, all generated by perturbing
	an input velocity structure.

SEE Makefile for subroutine dependencies
	all the programs should compile with just
	this directory.

All the main programs get the waveform and
	set up the initial models.

	Subroutine jinv does the actual inversion.
	This routine contains many options for inverting
	waveforms jointly (P & S; multiple P waves, etc)
	but will not work for such inversions as is.
	Modify and test the program before inverting
	multiple waveforms. (jinv.or.f is the original
	jinv routine by GER).

Subdirectories
	Test.Manyinv	single waveform tests
	Test.Smthinv	smoothing sweep tests
	Test.Snglinv	single waveform tests

	see ../RForward/Subs functions & routines

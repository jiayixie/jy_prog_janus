This directory includes precompiled results of AFTAN analysis
performed for cross-correlation of station pair M14A-M17A 
taken from IRIS Product [1].
The script run makes AFTAN analysis by aftan_c_test and aftan_f_test
and stored results in ctest and ftest subdirectory accordingly.
The results for the both programs are identical.
Another GMT script run_plot plots AFTAN maps (basic and phase match filtered)
for aftan_c_test program only in the file ctest/COR_TA.M14A_TA.M17A.SAC.ps
On both maps solid dark blue line represents cleaned segment of group 
velocities and dashed dark blue line cleaned segment of phase velocity
(from files ctest/COR_TA.M14A_TA.M17A.SAC_1_DISP.1 and
COR_TA.M14A_TA.M17A.SAC_2_DISP.1). The whole range of velocities is
plotted by white color lines and mostly overlapped by cleaned segments
(files COR_TA.M14A_TA.M17A.SAC_1_DISP.0 and
COR_TA.M14A_TA.M17A.SAC_2_DISP.0).
AFTAN analysis is done for the period range 4-30 seconds, but
due to nature of signal actual range for group and phase velocities
is shrinked to 7-28 sec for basic AFTAN, and, even more, to 8-25 for 
phase matched AFTAN. 

To run AFTAN go to TEST2 subdirectory.

======================
  This directory is the complete precomputed output of test example 
  for the MINEOS package. The output of the minos_bran and eigcon
  programs are excluded due to large size. The test had been computed
  for the model prem_noocean, for 10 seismic stations around the word,
  and for an event in Southern China:
  lat = 25.39N, lon = 101.40E, depth = 33.00 km, Mb = 5.4, Ms = 5.9,
  region - YUNNAN PROVINCE, M0 = 8.33e24 dyn*cm,
  fault plane 1 (degree) = 27 (deep) 78 (sleep) -6 (strike),
  fault plane 2 (degree) = 184 (deep) 84 (sleep) -168 (strike).
  Eigenfunctions are computed in: frequency range 0 - 125 mHz,
  radial order n range 1-30, and angular order l range 1 - 8000.
  The most important information related with the test are the the 7 databases:
    test_S         - eigenfunction databas for speroidal mode
    test_T         - eigenfunction databas for toroidal mode
    test_R         - eigenfunction databas for radial mode
    green          - Green function database;
    Syndat         - synthetic seismograms database
    short          - input .site and .sitechan database
    long           - another example of .site and .sitechan database for 
                     150 stations

    The file china_cmt_event is the event CMT data for the green program

2.1 Viewing relation tables using ANTELOPE dbe.
                      
    Enter command:
                  
  ... % dbe Syndat
                  
  dbe opens small graphic windows with title Syndat controlled by the mouse.
  Open the desired relation by left mouse click on some button with
  labels: "origin", "site", "sitechan", or "wfdisc". dbe opens for you
  a subwindow with the corresponding table. Use vertical or horizontal
  scrollbars to see data. dbe shows not all fields in a relation.
  To see more click left mouse on the main Menu "View"-->"Arrange"
  pick up new set of fields, and click "OK". To kill a subwindow press
  "Dismiss" at the bottom by left mouse click. Repeat this procedure
  for all relations. At the and click "Quit" on the main window.
                      
2.2 Viewing synthetic seismograms with ANTELOPE dbpick.
                      
    Enter command:
                  
  ... % dbpick Syndat
                     
  dbpick opens graphic windows with title Syndat controlled by the mouse.
  The shell window from which dbpick starts becomes the input/output
  text control terminal to input dbpick commands and output dbpick
  messages.
1. Fit the window. Click right mouse near the horizontal slider
  at the bottom of the window and click again label "Fit" on the
  dropdown menu. You will see the whole range of data.
2. Use the vertical slider to move across stations. Stop at some place
  and select some stations with a left mouse click. Use the
  menu sequence from the main menu to view selected stations on a
  separate subwindow, namely, "Traces"-->"NewWin"
3. Fix the amplitude scale with the left mouse. "Amp:A"-->"Fixed".
  To unfix use "Amp:A"-->"Auto"
4. Click right or left mouse on blue seismogram field to move
  record to the left or to the right.
5. To select part of the data and magnify it to the full horizontal width
  use the next procedure. Set mouse in some position on seismogram.
  Press "Shift" keyboard key and left mouse simultaneously, hold
  both and drag mouse to the right up to desired position. The yellow
  rectangle will shows the selected segment, Release "Shift" and left
  mouse. Click left mouse again. Needs some practice to get good.
6. Filtering. Use menu "Filter:N". Recommended filters:
  "Filter:N"-->"0.005-0.1BP" (bandpass filter in frequency range:
  0.005-0.1 Hz, T: 10-200 s) or "Filter:N"-->"0.005-0.05BP" (T: 20-200 s).
  "Filter:N"-->"None" will release filtering.
7. Mark data with iaspei travel times.
  Close all subwindows or exit from dbpick with quit command:
      dbpick> quit
  If quit, start it again: ... % dbpick Syndat
  enter two commands:
                      
      dbpick> se 1
      dbpick> sp P,S,PP,SS
                      
  The first command reads the event from the .origin table and the second one
  marks  for that event the iaspei (default model) travel times of
  different phases. The phase name conception is standard, like, PPP, PKP, etc.
  WARNING. Some versions of dbpick output all channels in a
  single screen and the vertical slider does not work. It is very hard to see
  station and channel names. To fight against this you can select a
  small portion of the data with a procedure described in point 5 of 2.3. 
  But you must use key "Control" instead of "Shift" and drag mouse
  down the screen. Select the portion of data and analyse it in the
  new subwindow.
                      
2.3 Viewing synthetic seismograms with SAC
                      
  Users who prefer to view data with SAC have to convert data to SAC
  format to some dir, say Syndat_SAC 

       ... % cucss2sac Syndat Syndat_SAC

  then, enter the commands

       ... % cd Syndat_SAC
       ... % sac
                      
  and work with data in the SAC environment.

NOTE that Green functions (green database) may be viewed in the same way
as synthetic seismograms (Syndat database).

this directory contains the code that has different forward computation.
*the Lkernel is directly computed from Mineos, not through Vkernel
*Test_fwd_cpt.C contains the subroutine that tests the accuracy of the computed dispersion curves with different kernel, these subroutines are called in the Main program
*BIN_rw_Love.C is updated on Nov21, sometimes the in.tellg() returns -1, don't know why... need to be fixed, right now I just skip reading models once tellg() returns -1
